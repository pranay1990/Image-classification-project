# Image-classification-project
It is image classifcation project done in IIT Kanpur
## Image Detect challenge has 200 classes. Each class has 450 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 test images. We have training, validation and test sets with images and annotations. We have both class labels and bounding boxes as annotations; however, we are going to predict the class label of each image without localizing the objects. The test set has no labels.
